    <div class="first-q">04. What are CSS combinators </div>
    <p>Combinators combine the selectors to provide them a useful relationship and the
        position of content in the document. This comes in handy when you want to style
        certain elements all at once rather than styling elements individually. CSS
        combinator selectors are as follows.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Descendant Selector (space)</li>
        <li>Child Selector (>)</li>
        <li>Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)</li>
        <li>General Sibling Selector (~)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Descendant Selector : The descendant selector matches all elements that are
        descendants of a specified element.</p>
    <p>Child Selector : The child selector will only affect elements under a direct
        parent. A good way to remember this is that a child will only listen to its direct
        parents.</p>
    <p>Adjacent Sibling Selector : To use the adjacent sibling selector in your CSS
        stylesheet, you simply need the plus (+) sign. The adjacent sibling selector is used
        to select an element that is directly after another specific element.</p>
    <p>General Sibling Selectors :The general sibling selector follows through on all
        elements under the targeted HTML element selected. This means that if another
        element tag interrupts the direct adjacent flow, the style rules can still follow
        through.</p>

    <div class="first-q">05. What are pseudo selectors in CSS</div>
    <p>CSS pseudo-classes are used to add styles to selectors, but only when those
        selectors meet certain conditions. A pseudo class is expressed by adding a colon (:)
        after a selector in CSS, followed by a pseudo-class such as "hover", "focus", or
        "active", like this:</p>
    <div class="ps"></div>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>:active </td>
            <td>It is used to add style to an active element.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>:hover</td>
            <td>It adds special effects to an element when the user moves the
                mouse pointer over the element.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>:link</td>
            <td>It adds style to the unvisited link.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>:visited</td>
            <td>It adds style to a visited link.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>:lang</td>
            <td>It is used to define a language to use in a specified element.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>:focus</td>
            <td>It selects the element which is focused by the user currently.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>:first-child</td>
            <td>It adds special effects to an element, which is the first child of
                another element.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
